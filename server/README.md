# Project structure üèó

The API codebase is fairly simple and should be easy enough to understand.

<br>

| File or folder    | Description                                                                                                            |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/index.ts`    | The entry file. This is where we setup middleware, attach routes, initialize database and express.                     |
| `src/routes.ts`   | This is where we define all routes.                                                                                    |
| `src/constants`   | Constants are values that never change and are used in multiple places across the codebase.                            |
| `src/controllers` | Controllers listen to client's requests and work with entities and the database to fetch, add, update, or delete data. |
| `src/database`    | Database related code and seeds go here.                                                                               |
| `src/models`		  | This is where we create sequelize model. We define columns, relations, validations for each database 						|model.					  																																							    | 
| `src/errors`		  | This is where we define custom errors. The `catchErrors` function helps us avoid repetitive `try/catch` blocks within	| controllers. 																                                                                                | 
| `src/middleware`  | Middleware functions can modify request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, etc. For example  			|`authenticateUser` method verifies the authorization token and attaches `currentUser` to the request object. 											 | 
| `src/associations`| Create associations between models. 																												| 
| `src/utils` | Utility(helper) functions that are used in multiple places across the codebase. 															|
